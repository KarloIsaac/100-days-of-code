### Day 6. 24 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Adjusted the pane for adding ingredients, added a new scroll and prepared a ingredients grid

**Thoughts:** I keep in mind building the simplest viable project, don't want to get lost in the details.

### Day 7. 25 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Created a function to aggregate ingredients register rows, changed how these rows are included in the GridPane

**Thoughts:** Keep struggling not to get lost trying to make a perfect GUI, I want to focus in something functional giving priority to the logic of the program.

### Day 8. 26 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Basic recipe register view done.

### Day 9. 27 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Changed the add button to each new ingredient rows, prepared a consumer to inform of the row requesting save.

**Thoughts:** Having second thoughts abour using JavaFX, finding MigLayout much more versatile and easy to use, again considering to to WebView to build the GUI but don't want to be absorbed on building the GUI, I want to focus on the logic.

### Day 10. 28 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Separated the logic of the Ingredient row view, all is now in a sepatated controller, started working on the delete Ingredient row capability.

**Today's Progress:** Went back and forth trying to figure out the best way to connect model and view.

### Day 34. 23 July 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Started chanching the structure to avoid having maps to reference the GroupsViews

**Today's Progress:** Refactored my code generalzing the wired blocks creator in order for it to create any kind of nodes.

**Thoughts:** I had to build a class just to realize tha functionality was alrready some where else, but I guess that is better than just staring at the code trying to figure out what to do next.
