# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1. 19 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Prepared the github repository.

**Thoughts:** I am starting in a period where I'm releasing an update to my traceability project at work so I'm very busy but if I don't start now there will always be excuses.

### Day 2. 20 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Could barely add a description capability in the Ingredietn object, could not make my mind about an Ingredient catalog.

**Thoughts:** I couldn't concentrate as much as a would have liked.

### Day 3. 21 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Removed the test meals source. Started studying JavaFX because I plan to build my GUI with this API

**Thoughts:** Could not code much, most of my time went on plannig and styding.

### Day 4. 22 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Did some tests for the gui in JavaFX

### Day 5. 23 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Created a recipe ingredient adder view

**Thoughts:** Must spend more time in actual coding and less reading the JavaFX documentation.

### Day 6. 24 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Adjusted the pane for adding ingredients, added a new scroll and prepared a ingredients grid

**Thoughts:** I keep in mind building the simplest viable project, don't want to get lost in the details.

### Day 7. 25 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Created a function to aggregate ingredients register rows, changed how these rows are included in the GridPane

**Thoughts:** Keep struggling not to get lost trying to make a perfect GUI, I want to focus in something functional giving priority to the logic of the program.

### Day 8. 26 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Basic recipe register view done.

**Thoughts:** the view ain't nice but does the job, I don't wanna spend much time making it nice (for now).

### Day 9. 27 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Changed the add button to each new ingredient rows, prepared a consumer to inform of the row requesting save.

**Thoughts:** Having second thoughts abour using JavaFX, finding MigLayout much more versatile and easy to use, again considering to to WebView to build the GUI but don't want to be absorbed on building the GUI, I want to focus on the logic.

### Day 10. 28 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Separated the logic of the Ingredient row view, all is now in a sepatated controller, started working on the delete Ingredient row capability.

**Thoughts:** I don't think I like JavaFX, not very versatile, maybe I need to learn a little bit more.

### Day 11. 29 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Prepared the Recipe adder to delete ingredients rows.

**Thoughts:** Spend much time studying the basic concepts of XML, I believe tomorrow I'll be ready to prepare some recipes in this format.

### Day 12. 30 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Defined and finished the structure of one recipe in my XML format.

**Thoughts:** Thinking and analyzing the XML structure took me all the time.

### Day 13. 1 July 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Prepared the directories for the jar to find the recipes directory and at the same time I can work from eclipse with this directories structure.

**Thoughts:** Too much XML studying, almost no new code.

### Day 14. 2 July 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Created a centrilized class to access the xml recipe files, started changing the recipe registry view to also include preparation time and foot notes.

**Thoughts:** Struggled trying no to think too much and coding more, even if later I need to change it.

### Day 15. 3 July 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Gave the Ingredients object the capability to exist without needing a quantity set.

**Thoughts:** The flag ingredients are important for the time the recipe says "add to the taste".

### Day 16. 4 July 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Started building the diet design form.

### Day 17. 5 July 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Working on diet planner gui, preparing the embedding structure in wich the meals w'll be distributed.
