# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1. 19 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Prepared the github repository.

**Thoughts:** I am starting in a period where I'm releasing an update to my traceability project at work so I'm very busy but if I don't start now there will always be excuses.

### Day 2. 20 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Could barely add a description capability in the Ingredietn object, could not make my mind about an Ingredient catalog.

**Thoughts:** I couldn't concentrate as much as a would have liked.

### Day 3. 21 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Removed the test meals source. Started studying JavaFX because I plan to build my GUI with this API

**Thoughts:** Could not code much, most of my time went on plannig and styding.

### Day 4. 22 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Did some tests for the gui in JavaFX

### Day 5. 23 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Created a recipe ingredient adder view

**Thoughts:** Must spend more time in actual coding and less reading the JavaFX documentation.

### Day 6. 24 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Adjusted the pane for adding ingredients, added a new scroll and prepared a ingredients grid

**Thoughts:** I keep in mind building the simplest viable project, don't want to get lost in the details.

### Day 7. 25 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Created a function to aggregate ingredients register rows, changed how these rows are included in the GridPane

**Thoughts:** Keep struggling not to get lost trying to make a perfect GUI, I want to focus in something functional giving priority to the logic of the program.

### Day 8. 26 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Basic recipe register view done.

**Thoughts:** the view ain't nice but does the job, I don't wanna spend much time making it nice (for now).

### Day 9. 28 June 2017.
**Today's Progress:** Changed the add button to each new ingredient rows, prepared a consumer to inform of the row requesting save.

**Thoughts:** Having second thoughts abour using JavaFX, finding MigLayout much more versatile and easy to use, again considering to to WebView to build the GUI but don't want to be absorbed on building the GUI, I want to focus on the logic.
